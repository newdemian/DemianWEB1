 2014, <br>             this<br> article<br> has been updated as of February 2018 to ensure that all the HTML editors listed are still available for free download. Any new information on latest versions has been added to this list.

During the original testing process, <br><br><br>over 100 HTML editors for Windows were evaluated against more than 40 different criteria relevant to both professional and beginning web designers and web developers, as well as small business owners. From that testing, ten HTML editors that stood above the rest were selected. Best of all, all of these editors also happen to be free!
